# Mahmir-pug-template
is a template, created to make the proccess of developing static HTML/SASS websites easier.
it helps you render html components (written in pug) in a nested way, so you can develop static sites, componental, like react!
so you might say it's a kind of router, built on top of pug, with a compiler that is watching your files for changes so you can see the result of your work as fast as possible!

## getting started
1. first clone this repository in your own system
2. then, install the required dependencies, using this comman: `npm install'
3. you need to install `sass` and `live-server` globally, so run `npm install -g sass` and `npm istall -g live-server`

that's it! now just open the project in your favorite editor, start the compiler script (start.bat for windows and start.sh for linux)

create your new pages in the `pages` folder, and write some pug code!
